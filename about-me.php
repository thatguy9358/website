            I am a cybersecuirty professional with 5+ years experience based in the Boston, Massachussets area.

            My strongest experience is in netowrk pentesting and web application pentesting. That is my main focus area and what I enjoy the most.
            I also have experience running static and dynamic analysis tools for application testing. Once upon a time I supported the Risk Manangement Framework
            lifecycle for a Raytheon program, so I'm no stranger to Nessus and NIST SP 800-53 as well.<br><br>
